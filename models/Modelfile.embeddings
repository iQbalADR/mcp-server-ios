# iOS Embeddings Model Configuration
# ===================================
#
# This Modelfile creates an embedding model optimized for iOS/Swift code.
# While we use the standard nomic-embed-text, this documents the configuration.
#
# For code embeddings, we want the model to understand:
# - Swift syntax and semantics
# - iOS framework terminology
# - Common iOS patterns and architectures
#
# Note: Custom embedding models require fine-tuning which is beyond Ollama's
# current capabilities. Use nomic-embed-text or mxbai-embed-large for now.

# Embedding models typically don't need system prompts, but this documents intent
SYSTEM """Generate semantic embeddings for iOS/Swift code that capture:
- Function and class purpose
- Architectural patterns used
- Framework dependencies
- Code relationships and similarities"""
